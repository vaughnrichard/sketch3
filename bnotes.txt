easiest way - spectrogram (fft vs time) (also shows different notes at different time)
 - trade-off: computationally heavy

other approach - short time fourier transform - (over shorter time) - could be used to pull out singular notes in specific time

wavelets - better for analysis for signals that have shorter and longer term data. good for data computationally

cross-correlation analysis - could also be used to pull out data
